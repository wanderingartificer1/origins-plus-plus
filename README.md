Origins++ is a collection of more than 100 origins to fully expand the origins experience.

## Building 
- This repository contains the shared resources for the Fabric and Forge versions.
- To build the project, go to either the [Fabric Workspace](https://github.com/QuantumXenon/origins-plus-plus-fabric) or the [Forge Workspace](https://github.com/QuantumXenon/origins-plus-plus-forge).
  
## Mod Compatibility
- Origins++ itself has built-in support for some items from some mods, and [this](https://github.com/QuantumXenon/origins-plus-plus-modded-support) datapack can be used to add additional items to the tags used by Origins++
  
## Mod Loader Support 
- Fabric is the main mod-loaders for Origins++. Most bugs on will likely be caused by issues with Origins++ itself, so I will fix them.
- Quilt is only marked as supported on some versions of Origins. Most bugs on these versions will likely be caused by issues with Origins++ itself, so I will fix them.
- Forge is supported on a best-effort basis as many issues are caused by Origins (Forge), so I will not be able to fix them. I will still fix any issues caused by Origins++ itself.

## Credits
- All credit for the original origins goes to the [original authors](https://gist.github.com/QuantumXenon/d7ec9ceee0f8897410cff5088307f028).
